Compilation has to be done in two steps. First, we must compile the _pocket-auth_ tool:

Once compiled, we are ready to generate the authentication tokens from _Pocket_ 

    $ ./pocket-auth

    $
    $ Received token: 123456abc-3eb0-cf32-0f92-6ff5b6
    $
    $ Enter the following URL and confirm the app (Enter when done)
    $
    $ https://getpocket.com/auth/authorize?request_token=123456abc-3eb0-cf32-0f92-6ff5b6&redirect_uri=https://github.com 
    $
    $ config.h file successfully created. Continue with 'make pocket-cli'

We are ready to go:
